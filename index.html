            This project examines the concept of concealing the authentication interface on websites. 
            The terms <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity">Security through Obscurity</a> or

            Steganoauthentication</a> could potentially be considered for this purpose; 
            however, both terms already have established meanings that differ from our concept. 
            Our focus, however, is on <span class="term">Steganeisodos</span> (from the Greek Steganós, meaning "hidden," and Eísodos, meaning "access" or "entry"), 
            which we will also refer to as <span class="term">Authentication Interface Concealment (AIC)</span>.

                <strong>Steganeisodos</strong> synonymous with <strong>Authentication Interface Concealment (AIC)</strong>, 
                is a security design methodology that utilizes a hidden, undocumented mechanism as its core. This mechanism is accessed via an entry point that can either be a publicly visible interface &ndash; whose apparent function is standard authentication &ndash; or a completely non-obvious interaction point. Access is granted upon activation by a specific, predefined trigger condition (such as entering a secret password or performing a sequence of actions), unlocking a concealed area or functionality of the system.
